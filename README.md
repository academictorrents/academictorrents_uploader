Uploader for Academic Torrents
==============================

GUI for uploading to Academic Torrents.  You will need an account first.  Currently requires:
- Python 3
- bencode module
- PyQt5

Eventually I will try to distribute a cross-platform executable to make this easier to use.

Instructions
------------

1. Run the uploader (from the command line, navigate to the file directory and type "python3 academictorrents_uploader.py")
2. Log in to Academic Torrents and copy your API key (https://academictorrents.com/my.php) into the field.
3. Select a file or directory to create a torrent from (other methods not yet implemented).
4. Input metadata.
5. Upload.

Feedback very much appreciated!
